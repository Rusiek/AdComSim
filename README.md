How to use it?
It's really simply. 

1. Type in how many industries have you automated.
2. Type in how many resources you have.
3. For every industry type in how many producers you have and how many resources per second it produce.
4. Type in Bonus and Luck

Improtant! If game shows you have 300.23M farmers and they produce 4.20AA you have too type in 3rd line: 
300.23M 4.20AA
Don't try to write values like 300.23M as 300230000 e.t.c., just copy what you see on your screen.

Now you have three options.
1. Type in data again (same rules like before).
2. Check how many resources you will have after time.

  Important! Insert one exactly sequence of chars like 30s or 3h30min.
  'd' - days
  'h' - houres
  'm' - minutes
  's' - seconds

3. Add a multipler
  1. Power/Speed
    1. Global upgrade
    2. Unit upgrade
